# Customizations over upstream Servo

Baseline: Servo `v0.4.0` (<https://github.com/servo/servo/archive/refs/tags/v0.4.0.zip>).

This file lists every deviation from that pristine upstream source, in the order they were
made. See `CLAUDE.md` for why this file exists and the protocol for keeping it current —
short version: **add an entry here in the same turn you change a file under `servo/`.**

Each entry: file path, upstream location the change replaces, what changed, why, and the
matching patch file under `patches/servo-v0.4.0/` that makes the change mechanically
reproducible (see `CLAUDE.md` — `.github/workflows/servo-test-build.yml` applies those
patches to a fresh pristine download on every run once it's actually running somewhere, so
they must stay in sync with reality).

## 2026-08-05 — Remove toolbar and tab strip UI entirely

**File:** `ports/servoshell/desktop/gui.rs`, in `Gui::update` (was line ~392-579 in the
`v0.4.0` baseline).

**Patch:** `patches/servo-v0.4.0/0001-remove-toolbar-and-tabs.patch`

**Upstream behavior:** the top toolbar (back/forward/reload/stop, address bar, experimental
prefs toggle) and the tab strip (tab list, new-tab button, new-window button) were drawn
inside `if winit_window.fullscreen().is_none() { ... } else { *toolbar_height = Length::default(); }`
— i.e. shown in windowed mode, hidden only when the OS window itself was in fullscreen.

**Change:** replaced the entire `if/else` block with a single unconditional statement:

```rust
// Kiosk/embedded fork: never draw the toolbar or tab strip, in windowed
// mode or fullscreen — this build is meant to look like a native app
// window, not a browser.
*toolbar_height = Length::default();
```

All of the removed block's code (toolbar buttons, address bar, tab strip, new-tab/new-window
buttons) was deleted, not just made unreachable — there is no dead code left behind.

**Why:** this build is meant to present as a normal native application window (like a Tauri
app), not as a browser with tabs — regardless of whether the window is fullscreen or not.
Upstream only hid this UI in fullscreen; the project's requirement is to hide it always.

**Side effects to know about when upgrading:** the `location` and `location_dirty` fields
destructured from `Self` at the top of `Gui::update` are no longer used anywhere in that
function (their only call sites were inside the removed block). This produces two harmless
`unused variable` warnings — not errors (`servoshell`'s `Cargo.toml` has no
`deny(warnings)`/`forbid(warnings)`). Not fixed further since it's cosmetic; revisit if this
crate ever turns warnings into errors.

## 2026-08-06 — Skip GStreamer DLL packaging on Windows when media is disabled

**File:** `python/servo/build_commands.py`, `run_post_build_tasks` (Windows branch) and
`copy_windows_dlls_to_build_directory` (was line ~197-347 in the `v0.4.0` baseline).

**Patch:** `patches/servo-v0.4.0/0002-skip-gstreamer-dll-copy-when-media-disabled.patch`

**Upstream behavior:** after a successful build, `run_post_build_tasks` packages
platform-specific runtime files. On macOS this is correctly gated on `self.enable_media`
(only copies GStreamer dylibs if the media stack is actually enabled). On Windows, the
equivalent call — `copy_windows_dlls_to_build_directory` → `package_gstreamer_dlls` —
runs unconditionally regardless of `self.enable_media`, and hard-fails the whole build if
`servo.platform.get().gstreamer_root(...)` can't find a GStreamer install.

**Change:** `copy_windows_dlls_to_build_directory` now takes an `enable_media: bool`
parameter (passed as `self.enable_media` from the call site) and only calls
`package_gstreamer_dlls` when it's true, mirroring the existing darwin branch. ANGLE and
MSVC DLL copying are unaffected — those aren't GStreamer-related and still run
unconditionally.

**Why:** `../.github/workflows/test.yml` builds with `--media-stack dummy` specifically to
avoid needing GStreamer installed at all on CI (see that file's comments — installing it on
Windows would require an interactive UAC prompt that hangs forever on a GH runner). But this
upstream inconsistency meant the ~25-minute Windows compile still failed at the very last
step, in the post-build DLL-copy phase, with "Could not find GStreamer installation
directory." — independent of `--media-stack dummy` and independent of `--skip-platform`
during bootstrap. Without this fix, Windows CI can never pass while GStreamer bootstrap is
intentionally skipped.

## 2026-08-06 — Strip dead browser-navigation state and the favicon pipeline from `Gui`

**File:** `ports/servoshell/desktop/gui.rs`.

**Patch:** `patches/servo-v0.4.0/0003-strip-dead-browser-navigation-state-and-favicon-pipeline.patch`

**Upstream behavior:** even after the 2026-08-05 toolbar/tab removal (above), `Gui` kept
computing full browser-chrome state every frame with no remaining consumer:
`update_location_in_toolbar` (address-bar text), `update_load_status` (spinner/dirty-flag
bookkeeping), `update_can_go_back_and_forward` (back/forward button state), and
`load_pending_favicons`/`embedder_image_to_egui_image` (decoding each `WebView`'s favicon and
uploading it to a GPU texture, cached in `favicon_textures`). All four were only ever read by
the toolbar/tab-strip drawing code that patch 0001 deleted — actual back/forward navigation
(`Alt`+arrow keys etc.) calls `WebView::go_back`/`go_forward` directly in
`headed_window.rs`, bypassing `Gui` entirely, so none of this tracking gates any real
behavior.

**Change:** removed `update_location_in_toolbar`, `update_load_status`,
`update_can_go_back_and_forward`, `load_pending_favicons`, and
`embedder_image_to_egui_image` entirely, along with the `load_status`, `can_go_back`,
`can_go_forward`, and `favicon_textures` fields on `Gui` and the `load_pending_favicons`
call site in `Gui::update`. `update_webview_data` (called once per frame from
`headed_window.rs`) now just calls the one function that still has a real consumer —
`update_status_text`, which feeds the hover-status tooltip — instead of OR-ing together four
functions' change-flags.

The `location: String` and `location_dirty: bool` fields were **left in place** rather than
removed: after this change they're written once in `Gui::new` from the `_initial_url`
constructor parameter and never read again, which the compiler fully accounts for (same
"harmless unused" category the toolbar-removal patch already documented for these two
fields — see 2026-08-05 above) — with no runtime loop touching them anymore, removing them
would require threading a signature change through `create_platform_window` →
`HeadedWindow::new` → `Gui::new` across `app.rs` and `headed_window.rs` for zero behavioral
or binary-size benefit. The constructor parameter was renamed to `_initial_url` to document
that it's now unused for this purpose, without changing the parameter list itself (so
`headed_window.rs`'s call site didn't need touching).

**Deliberately left alone:** `browser_tab` and `toolbar_button` (the tab-strip widget and
toolbar-button helper) are dead code with zero callers anywhere in the crate — unlike the
functions above, they don't run every frame, they simply never run at all, so the compiler
already drops them from the linked binary in release builds. Removing the source would be
pure cosmetics with no effect on the shipped game package, so they were left as-is.

**Why:** this fork's `Gui` no longer draws any browser chrome (see 2026-08-05 above), so this
is the second half of that same cleanup: the *state* that only existed to feed that chrome
was tracked here too, and kept running every frame — recomputing back/forward capability,
diffing load status, and (worst of all) decoding and uploading a GPU texture per `WebView`
favicon — for a UI element that no longer exists. None of it is "dead code" the compiler can
optimize away, since `Gui::update` genuinely calls it every frame; it's live, wasted CPU/GPU
work in every build of the game, embedded or otherwise.

**Side effects to know about when upgrading:** if a future upstream Servo version changes how
`WebView::status_text`/`load_status`/`can_go_back`/`can_go_forward`/`favicon` are exposed,
re-check this patch still applies cleanly — it's a bigger diff than 0001 and touches more of
`Gui`'s internals. Not verified against an actual `./mach build` (Servo's build is
multi-hour and wasn't run for this change) — treat the next real build of this fork as the
actual verification and fix up any compile errors this patch introduces before relying on it.

## 2026-08-06 — New `mach bundle` command: package a build into something runnable

**File:** `python/servo/post_build_commands.py`.

**Patch:** `patches/servo-v0.4.0/0004-add-mach-bundle-command.patch`

**Upstream behavior:** `./mach build` leaves the raw Cargo output in `target/<profile>/` —
just the engine binary plus (on Windows) ANGLE/MSVC DLLs dropped next to it by
`copy_windows_dlls_to_build_directory`. Running that binary bare opens Servo's own default
start page, not this fork's intended content, and on Windows it has no window-size/URL args
set, so it isn't something a non-technical person can be handed and told to double-click.

**Change:** added a new command, `./mach bundle [--html-file dist/index.html]
[--window-size 1280x720] [--output DIR] [--content-dir DIR] [--deb] [-- extra servoshell
args]`, category `post-build`. It does **not** touch `target/<profile>/` or move the binary
Cargo put there — `./mach run` and everything else that calls `get_binary_path()` keeps
working exactly as before. Instead, into a separate output directory (default:
`target/<profile>/bundle/`) it produces, per platform:

- **Windows:** the engine binary + its DLLs moved into a `bin/` subdirectory, plus a real
  `play.exe` at the top level — a tiny std-only Rust program, compiled on the fly with plain
  `rustc` (no Cargo project), built with `#![windows_subsystem = "windows"]` (the same
  attribute `ports/servoshell/main.rs` already uses on `servoshell.exe` itself — see the
  2026-08-05 entries) so double-clicking it never flashes a console. It just spawns
  `bin/servoshell.exe` with the configured args and exits.
- **macOS:** a minimal `Servo.app` bundle (`Contents/Info.plist` + `Contents/MacOS/Servo`, a
  small shell script that `exec`s the engine binary — renamed `<binary>-core` and tucked
  inside the bundle — with the configured args). Finder launches
  `Contents/MacOS/Servo` directly; no `Terminal.app` involved at all, unlike double-clicking
  a loose `.sh`.
- **Linux (default):** the engine binary renamed `<binary>-core` **without its executable
  bit**, plus a `play.sh` that `chmod +x`'s it, sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and execs it with the
  configured args. `play.sh` is the only supported entry point; a curious
  `./<binary>-core` fails with "Permission denied" instead of launching without the
  args/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` it actually needs.
- **Linux with `--deb`:** a real, installable `.deb` instead (`<name>_<version>_<arch>.deb`,
  built via `dpkg-deb --build --root-owner-group`) — engine + content under
  `/usr/lib/<name>/`, a launcher at `/usr/bin/<name>`, and a `.desktop` entry so it shows up
  in application launchers. Requires `dpkg-deb` (from `dpkg-dev`) on `PATH`; raises
  `BuildNotFound` with a clear message if missing rather than a bare traceback. This is a
  functional package, not a lintian-clean one — no changelog, man page, or maintainer
  scripts.

`--content-dir` (e.g. a built `dist/`) is copied into the bundle at whatever relative
location `--html-file` expects it (default `dist/index.html` → a `dist/` next to the
launcher, or under `/usr/lib/<name>/` for `--deb`) — see `_place_bundle_content`. Passing it
is optional: a caller can instead place content into the output directory itself after the
command returns, which is how `../.github/workflows/test.yml`'s `assemble test bundle` step
originally worked before being simplified to just call this command directly.

**Why:** originally this exact logic (per-platform launcher, hidden/renamed core binary, no
console/Terminal) was hand-rolled as bash inside `../.github/workflows/test.yml`. That's
backwards: this fork's whole reason for existing is `git`-vendoring Servo instead of
depending on it as a black box (see `../CLAUDE.md`), specifically so *product* behavior like
"how does a build actually get handed to someone to run" lives in the product (`mach`), not
duplicated across whichever CI happens to build it. `../.github/workflows/embedded.yml` (the
*real* release pipeline) currently has its own near-identical hand-rolled
play.bat/play.sh generation, with the exact same "opens a terminal, no nice extension"
UX gap this command fixes — it doesn't consume this command yet because it doesn't build
from this fork at all today (it downloads upstream's official prebuilt binaries; see that
file's own comments), but the plan is for it to eventually point at this fork instead, at
which point it should switch to `./mach bundle` too instead of re-diverging.

**Side effects to know about when upgrading:** none of this depends on Servo internals
beyond `get_binary_path()`/`self.target` (stable, low-level `CommandBase` API), so it should
survive a version bump untouched. If a future Servo version changes what
`copy_windows_dlls_to_build_directory` drops next to the Windows binary, double check
`_bundle_windows`'s DLL glob still catches everything needed.
